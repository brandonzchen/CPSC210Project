# Running Tracker

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a run-tracking application tailored 
specifically for runners who are keen on monitoring their progress and analyzing their 
performance over time. This application aims to be more than just a simple log; it will serve 
as a comprehensive tool that allows users to enter details about their runs, including distance, 
time, and even the route taken. From these inputs, the application will perform various calculations, 
such as average speed, pace per kilometer, and the total distance run over specific periods. Designed with 
user-friendliness in mind, the application will cater to both amateur runners beginning their running journey and 
seasoned athletes looking to track their training meticulously. This project not only aligns with my newfound passion 
for running but also aims to continue my motivation to run every day. 


## Key Features:
- Fluent and comprehensive UI
- Ability to upload photos for route-tracking
- Save and load previous runs

## User Stories
- I want to be able to add a run to a running log
- I want to be able to edit a run in the running log
- I want to be able to delete runs from the running log
- I want to be able to select a run from the running log and view the details of the run
- I want to be able to add a photo of the route taken for the run
- I want to be able to save my running log (if I so choose)
- I want to be able to load a previous running log (if I so choose)

## Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required action related to the user story by clicking on the add run button. 
A new run can be added by filling out information from the pop-up menu.
- You can generate a second required action related to the user story by clicking the select run button and 
choosing the runs based on their index. 
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save runs button on the top right. 
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load runs button on the top right. 
- You can locate my visual component by staying on the main screen and looking in the top left.

## Phase 4: Task 3
One thing that I could have refactored was to expand the functionality of each run by having more classes to describe 
the features of each run. For example, having a class specifically for the date of the run would allow me to expand my 
UI to accomplish more detailed JFrames and achieve better modularity in the project. Another thing that I would change
is to implement an abstract UI class so that I would easily be able to implement more UI frames and decrease the 
amount of repeated code in my project. This would also help with understanding the relationships between the classes
and would increase the readability of my code.
